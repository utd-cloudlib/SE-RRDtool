Note:
1. Currently the input/parameters are not decided yet, because I don't know what's your design or need from the reasoner.

Now the program will read the ontology from "reasoning/ontology/Ontology_V1.06_rdf.owl". 

When everything is fixed, then we can modify this program to fit your need.

2. Usage:
java -jar reasoner.jar

3. The output is "reasoning/out/output.txt"

4. There is a prefix for analyzer name and sensor name. This prefix is built in the ontology, and the program keeps it. So don't worry about it. It's easy to manage.

5. This is the most important issue, about how to have a try on this program:
When you want to query something, then you can modify the file of "reasoning/r_analyzer/Analyzerfacts.clp"

Here you only need to change the item of "attribute":
As you know, "http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/2012/8/Ontology1348074741596.owl" is the prefix, just change the part of "ProcessingTime" or "DownTime". This is the entrance for your query.

You can see, multiple queries can work together.

So whenever you are ready for the queries, you will need to run the program once.

Then find your result in "reasoning/out/output.txt": it's the item of "attributeName"

6. Another important issue is: you also need to change "reasoning/r_sensor/Sensorfacts.clp"

This is a list for all the rrd files you have. This is usefull because all the reasoning results are based on these facts: every attribute in the final result has a corresponding rrd file to support it.

As you can see, in this way, we can finally get the target rrd file to operate for your rrdtool.

7. All the attributes here must be a concept in the ontology. You need to parse your mapping before this query.
